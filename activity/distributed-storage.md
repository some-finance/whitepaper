# Distributed Storage

By providing a 3D scene editor, Land NFT owners can edit the 3D buildings on their land, applying behaviors and interactive tools. Each area has its own unique (x, y) coordinates and the data edited by the land NFT holder can be stored decentralized and distributed, updating the NFT metadata held by the user in real time.
