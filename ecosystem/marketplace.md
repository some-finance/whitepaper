# Marketplace

Users can trade land, items, products, drawings or talents in the Marketplace.&#x20;

Each transaction will also generate a 5% transaction fee, and 50% of which will be burned. Another 40% will be used for paying the designer's royalty corresponding to the traded item, and the remaining 10% will be used as platform revenue.
