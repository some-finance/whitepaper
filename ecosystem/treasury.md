* **Linear decay mechanism of mining returns**

Similar to Bitcoin's half-life decay mechanism, when calculating the daily mining output, the daily mining output decreases linearly on a daily basis. This means that the total daily mining output is halved after the block height is reached.&#x20;

* **User Activity Award**

40% of the daily social mining award will be dynamically distributed based on the user's daily social activity. A user's daily social activity is defined as the time spent on the user's land by other users and the frequency and length of participation in the activity, weighted by other parameters. Work hard to improve your land and invite more people to visit you.

Of course, the system will determine whether the user is invalid social fraud, fraud is highly disgraceful, once found, not only will not get the corresponding rewards, and will even be punished appropriately by the DAO organization.

* **Invitation Award**

The 30% daily social mining award will be dynamically distributed based on the activity level of new users invited to the platform on that day.

SomeFi City's resident users can invite new users to join, and the invited user's social activity in SomeFi City will be tied to who invited the user. The invited user's social activity in SomeFi City will be weighted by the number of hours they spend on the land and the number of hours they participate in activities each day. The invitee can dynamically allocate an invitation incentive for the day based on the social activity of the users they have invited.

Invite your friends to explore SomeFi City with you. However, don't just invite them, but also accompany them to discover more about SomeFi City's gameplay and unique incentives. You will be their best guide!

* **Platform Activity Award**

30% of the daily social mining rewards will be used to incentivize live events on the platform, which will host a variety of exciting events to enrich the SomeFi City ecosystem.

Every day in SomeFi City is a day of fun. There are seasonal events such as cherry blossom season and snow season, as well as festivals that everyone loves, such as Halloween and Christmas, and sometimes special celebrity events or joint events with collaborative projects. Special tasks can be completed at specific times to get reward. The rewards are not only SOFI Token, but also special items, such as special Halloween costumes.

All live events and the corresponding live event rewards will be fully voted on the DAO organization. As a member of SomeFi City, we hope you will have a unique feast and a memorable time at SomeFi City.
