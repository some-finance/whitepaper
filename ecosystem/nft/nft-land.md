# NFT Land

The Somefi city is divided into areas such as exhibitions, marketplace, museums, amusement parks, parks, etc. NFT Land owners will share in revenue from leasing NFT Land and other entertainment activities of Somefi city. Each land NFT released by SomeFi City has unique (x, y) coordinates for locating its land NFT holdings in the mapping system. Land size: 1x1 land size 200m wide, 200m long, 128m buildable height. Users purchasing a land NFT are free to edit the 3D space within this size range, but the editable range of the land will fluctuate.

By providing a 3D scene editor, Land NFT owners can edit the 3D buildings on their land, applying behaviors and interactive tools. Each area has its own unique (x, y) coordinates and the data edited by the land NFT holder can be stored decentralized and distributed, updating the NFT metadata held by the user in real time.
