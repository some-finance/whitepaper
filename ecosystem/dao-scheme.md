# DAO Scheme

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAO owns the most important smart contracts and assets in the ecosystem. In the first fully decentralized world, SomeFi Network is controlled via the DAO. Users can control the policies created to determine the behavior of the world. The community will propose and vote on policy updates, future LAND auctions, whitelisting of NFT contracts to be allowed inside the World, Builder and Marketplace, and whatever the community deems relevant.
